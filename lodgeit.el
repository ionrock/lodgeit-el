;;; Commentary:

;; `lodgeit.el` allows you to easily submit regions to a lodgeit base
;; pastebin.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;;    (require 'lodgeit)
;;
;; You can then configure the pastebin you want to use via the
;; `lodgeit-pastebin-base` variable.
;;
;;    (setq lodgeit-pastebin-base "http://paste.openstack.org/")
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Select some region and `M-x lodgeit-paste`. The major mode should
;; be used to properly highlight the paste on the server. The URL is
;; added to the kill ring for pasting as needed.
;;

;;; Code:
(require 's)
(require 'json)
